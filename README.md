# hello-world
Hi, just learning github repositories.
Now learning about commiting changes.
I'm not a big time developer. I just like to study about software development in my free time.
Initially I hope to start with java.
These days I'm studying the basics of Java. Also I study other opensource program sources to get an idea about programming.
